# LINUX BASCIS

Linux is **case sensitive**.

### 🗃️ Linux File Types

Files that begin with a character indicate the type:

| Symbol | Type           | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| `-`    | Regular File   | Standard file (text, binary, etc.) |
| `d`    | Directory      | Folder containing files |
| `l`    | Link           | Shortcut to another file |
| `c`    | Character Device File| Represents hardware devices as files (e.g., keyboard, mouse, CPU, memory) |
| `b`    | Block Device File | Devices that handle data in blocks (e.g., hard drive, USB drive) |
| `s`    | Socket         | Used for network communication |
| `p`    | Named Pipe (FIFO) | Inter-process communication in FIFO order |
| `+`    | Access Control List (ACL) | Indicates a ACL permission has been set on the file/directory. |

#### 🔗 Links
- **Soft Link**: Like a shortcut. Breaks if the target is deleted.
- **Hard Link**: Another name for the same file. Doesn’t break if the original is deleted.

### 🫚 Root
- Root as `/` : very first direcotory also referred as root directory.
- Root home directory : `/root `
